# Rework the existing text editor from scratch and eliminate its imperfections

I don't see any point of rewriting whole thing from scratch, because:

- It's not that bad to throw it away
- I don't have any requirements (like complete list of features)
- I don't have any tests
- Telegram team is looking for the good developers to join their team, and I guess being a good developer won't touch something that is already working in this case.

## Ensure proper support for edit history (Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z doesnâ€™t work as intended as of now).

Current implementation (existing, before my fixes) using getSelection / ranges to insert pasted text
into the input field. Unfortunately this won't work in case if we need undo history. There are couple of alternatives of course:
- implement undo history stack manually, but this is bad idea because you'll basically have to recreate everything
that browser already doing + make sure that you keep enough records in undo history without wasting the memory.
- to use execCommand/insertHTML. This is deprecated: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand
but:
1) it's all over the existing code base already
2) there was no requirement in the contest's description - not to use it
3) it's supported
by all browsers despite that it's deprecated because of:
4) currently it has no alternative because of undo stack.

So obviously my fix is based on execCommand/insertHTML

## Add support for editing quotes.

Consists of several things:
1) Make sure that popup menu contains this new "quote" button, make sure that this "quote" button reflects proper state (turned on or off) based on the current context (whether or not our caret is inside the blockquote).

2) Wrap / unwrap selected text into ```<blockquote />``` html element when this button is pressed

3) Make sure that pressing up / down buttons while being at the beginning / end of the quote will insert new line before or after the quote so that the regular text can be inserted before or after it.

The only thing I'm not sure about - is support for nested quotes. Desktop / webk / mobile version have different behaviour related with this topic, my implementation uses stupid simple behaviour:

In case if our selection does not contain blockquote then - pressing "quote" button will wrap selected text into blockquote.
In case if our selection contains blockquote or laying inside of the blockquote, then we look for the first parent blockquote element, and then replace it with it's contents.
This will not allow us to create nested blockquotes, but will allow us to properly handle the content inside of such blockquotes.

Webk version splits the quote into quote + nonquote + quote html elements:

My implementation removes parent blockquote:

# Introduce the new Chat Folders appearance based on the provided mockups (https://t.me/contest/398)

Desktop version has it's own set of folder icons: https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/tree/dev/Telegram/Resources/icons/folders
In order to make web version a little bit more consistent, I've made a script to upload desktop version icons and preprocess it, so it can be used by the web version.

```sh
  npm run foldericons:build
```

This will do some hacky magic, upload icons and put them into ```public/folder-icons```

In case if the emoji is missing in this desktop icon set, it will fallback to the emoji "as it is", rendered using SVG. Of course it's going to be ugly
when this monochrome icons and color icons will meet together in the same time, but I guess it won't happen + it's not a production version, so I guess
it's acceptable in our situtation. Here is the comparison of web / desktop version:

Also I've made an effort to make this as a preference:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07776440-b6e6-4c0b-922c-7e36b18cd93e)

+ quick access to the folder settings at the bottom of the sidebar panel:

Support for desktop icons + emojis in the folder's name:

Properly count folder name length (based on UTF codepoints rather than string length), look at this 12 emojis:

Disable sidebar buttons when in the search mode:

Supports monochrome / color icons through the preference:

# Bonus Task
Add support for animated chat backgrounds as in other Telegram apps. For reference, check Telegram Web K (http://web.telegram.org/k) or this. (https://github.com/crashmax-dev/twallpaper-webgl)

Done using this library: https://github.com/crashmax-dev/twallpaper and set of patterns found here: https://arif.thedev.id/blogs/stylish-svg-patterns-unveiling-telegram-s-beauty
Colors are taken from Telegram Web K version.

Animated backgrounds defined in **animatedBackgrounds.json** file.
All patterns is located in **/public/patterns** directory.

# Build Proof

As the requirement is to provide an archive with the dist folder with the build... and because of my previous experience with it when I've got a penalty because Telegram team had to rebuild my submission...
This time I've decided to record screencast with complete build from the beginning and until running an app from the dist folder:

Click to watch the video on youtube:
[![Everything Is AWESOME]([https://i.sstatic.net/q3ceS.png](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45686abc-98c5-4e63-b662-018489c0e6f1))](https://youtu.be/P5OUmbgBYnk)

I'm doing all this not because "WELL IT'S WORKING FOR ME, THEN I DON'T CARE", but because:

I'm not the one who create this build script, who setup the project or who maintain it. Neither of contest tasks was mentioning something about fixing the webpack configuration or build script.
So I'm just running npm run ```build:dev``` and hope that the build artifacts produced in the dist folder will work for you as well as it's working for me.
