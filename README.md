# Ensure proper support for edit history (Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z doesnâ€™t work as intended as of now).

Current implementation (existing, before my fixes) using getSelection / ranges to insert pasted text
into the input field. Unfortunately this won't work in case if we need undo history. There are couple of alternatives of course:
- implement undo history stack manually, but this is bad idea because you'll basically have to recreate everything
that browser already doing + make sure that you keep enough records in undo history without wasting the memory.
- to use execCommand/insertHTML. This is deprecated: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand
but:
1) it's all over the existing code base already
2) there was no requirement in the contest's description - not to use it
3) it's supported
by all browsers despite that it's deprecated because of:
4) currently it has no alternative because of undo stack.

# Folders sidebar

Desktop version has it's own set of folder icons: https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/tree/dev/Telegram/Resources/icons/folders
In order to make web version a little bit more consistent, I've made a script to upload desktop version icons and preprocess it, so it can be used by the web version.

```sh
  npm run foldericons:build
```

This will do some hacky magic, upload icons and put them into ```public/folder-icons```

In case if the emoji is missing in this desktop icon set, it will fallback to the emoji "as it is", rendered using SVG. Of course it's going to be ugly
when this monochrome icons and color icons will meet together in the same time, but I guess it won't happen + it's not a production version, so I guess
it's acceptable in our situtation. Here is the comparison of web / desktop version:

Also I've made an effort to make this as a preference:

+ quick access to the folder settings at the bottom of the sidebar panel:

Support for desktop icons + emojis in the folder's name:

Properly count folder name length (based on UTF codepoints rather than string length), look at this 12 emojis:

Disable sidebar buttons when in the search mode:

# Telegram Web A

This project won the first prize ðŸ¥‡ at [Telegram Lightweight Client Contest](https://contest.com/javascript-web-3) and now is an official Telegram client available to anyone at [web.telegram.org/a](https://web.telegram.org/a).

According to the original contest rules, it has nearly zero dependencies and is fully based on its own [Teact](https://github.com/Ajaxy/teact) framework (which re-implements React paradigm). It also uses a custom version of [GramJS](https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs) as an MTProto implementation.

The project incorporates lots of technologically advanced features, modern Web APIs and techniques: WebSockets, Web Workers and WebAssembly, multi-level caching and PWA, voice recording and media streaming, cryptography and raw binary data operations, optimistic and progressive interfaces, complicated CSS/Canvas/SVG animations, reactive data streams, and so much more.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback and contribute.

## Local setup

```sh
mv .env.example .env

npm i
```

Obtain API ID and API hash on [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and populate the `.env` file.

## Dev mode

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Invoking API from console

Start your dev server and locate GramJS worker in console context.

All constructors and functions available in global `GramJs` variable.

Run `npm run gramjs:tl full` to get access to all available Telegram requests.

Example usage:
``` javascript
await invoke(new GramJs.help.GetAppConfig())
```

## Electron

Electron allows building a native application that can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### NPM scripts

- `npm run dev:electron`

Run Electron in development mode, concurrently starts 3 processes with watch for changes: main (main Electron process), renderer (FE code) and Webpack for Electron (compiles main Electron process from TypeScript).

- `npm run electron:webpack`

The main process code for Electron, which includes preload functionality, is written in TypeScript and is compiled using the `webpack-electron.config.js` configuration to generate JavaScript code.

- `npm run electron:build`

Prepare renderer (FE code) build, compile Electron main process code, install and build native dependencies, is used before packaging or publishing.

- `npm run electron:staging`

Create packages for macOS, Windows and Linux in `dist-electron` folders with `APP_ENV` as `staging` (allows to open DevTools, includes sourcemaps and does not minify built JavaScript code), can be used for manual distribution and testing packaged application.

- `npm run electron:production`

Create packages for macOS, Windows and Linux in `dist-electron` folders with `APP_ENV` as `production` (disabled DevTools, minified built JavaScript code), can be used for manual distribution and testing packaged application.

- `npm run deploy:electron`

Create packages for macOS, Windows and Linux in `dist-electron` folder and publish release to GitHub, which allows supporting autoupdates. See [GitHub release workflow](#github-release) for more info.

#### Code signing on MacOS

To sign the code of your application, follow these steps:

- Install certificates from `/certs` folder to `login` folder of your Keychain.
- Download and install `Developer ID - G2` certificate from the [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/) page.
- Under the Keychain application, go to the private key associated with your developer certificate. Then do `key > Get Info > Access Control`. Down there, make sure your application (Xcode) is in the list `Always allow access by these applications` and make sure `Confirm before allowing access` is turned on.
- A valid and appropriate identity from your keychain will be automatically used when you publish your application.

More info in the [official documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/code-signing).

#### Notarize on MacOS

Application notarization is done automatically in [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/) module, which requires `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` environment variables to be passed.

How to obtain app-specific password:

- Sign in to [appleid.apple.com](appleid.apple.com).
- In the "Sign-In and Security" section, select "App-Specific Passwords".
- Select "Generate an app-specific password" or select the Add button, then follow the steps on your screen.

#### GitHub release

##### GitHub access token

In order to publish new release, you need to add GitHub access token to `.env`. Generate a GitHub access token by going to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. The access token should have the repo scope/permission. Once you have the token, assign it to an environment variable:

```
# .env
GH_TOKEN="{YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}"
```

##### Publish settings

Publish configuration in `src/electron/config.yml` config file allows to set GitHub repository owner/name.

##### Release workflow

- Run `npm run electron:publish`, which will create new draft release and upload build artefacts to newly reated release. Version of created release will be the same as in `package.json`.
- Once you are done, publish the release. GitHub will tag the latest commit.
